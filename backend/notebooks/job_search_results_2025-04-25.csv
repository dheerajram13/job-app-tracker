Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!


Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

 **Where and how you can work**


Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co\-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.  

  

While this role will be collaborating closely with our team based in Beijing, this position is Australia based.

 **What you’d be doing in this role**


The CJKI Experience Team is the frontend engineering team supporting the CJKI group, which drives user and revenue growth in China, Japan, South Korea, and India. As part of Canva's “Truly Local” strategy, we aim to provide the most localized user experience possible, contributing to Canva’s mission to empower the world to design.


As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.


At the moment, this role is focused on:

* Collaborating closely with product designers and managers within the CJKI group to create and enhance experiments aimed at boosting user growth in local markets.
* Partnering with cross\-functional teams to grasp local user requirements and guarantee the smooth integration of frontend libraries into localized projects.
* Designing, developing, and maintaining reusable frontend components and libraries utilizing modern JavaScript frameworks and tools.
* Improving frontend libraries and experiments for performance, accessibility, and maintainability, with a particular emphasis on supporting new and emerging markets.
* Implementing and testing strategies while ensuring the quality and reliability of the code through automated testing processes.
* Keeping current with the latest frontend technologies and best practices to ensure the team utilizes the most effective tools and methodologies.


You're probably a match if

* You possess proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and contemporary frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
* You are knowledgeable about frontend build tools including Webpack, Rollup, or Babel.
* You have some experience with testing frameworks like Jest, Enzyme, or Cypress.
* You possess a strong understanding of web performance optimization techniques and accessibility standards.
* You have a solid foundation in computer science and engineering principles, encompassing concurrency, multithreading, data structures, solution design, architecture, and design patterns.
* You are well\-versed in key browser concepts, including the event loop, bubbling/capturing, and the rendering pipeline.
* You thrive in collaborative environments, enjoying teamwork and effective communication.
* You have outstanding communication skills and enjoy fostering relationships with a diverse range of individuals to drive meaningful impact across the organization.

**Since the role will be operating heavily with our Beijing based team members and focus on rolling out localised features across multiple regions including China, we are ideally looking for a talented engineer who is fluent in Mandarin.**  



  

**About the team**


The CJKI Experience team is dedicated to customizing our product to meet the unique needs of each local market, recognizing that every market has distinct cultural, habitual, financial, and ecosystem differences. We aim to address these variations through targeted experiments and close collaboration with local teams, ensuring we deliver the best possible product and user experience tailored to each market.  

  

This team operates in a hybrid model, with members located in both Australia and China. As a colleague based in Australia, you will work closely with your local teammates as well as our team members situated in Beijing (all while respecting the Australian working hours!).

 **What's in it for you?**


Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard \- and we do \- but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.


Here's a taste of what's on offer:

* Equity packages \- we want our success to be yours too
* Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents \& carers
* An annual Vibe \& Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup \& more
* Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
