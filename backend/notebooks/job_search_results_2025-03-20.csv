Amber is a **new way to buy and sell power,** designed for a world powered by renewable energy. We give customers direct access to the real\-time wholesale electricity price as it varies every 5 mins. We then provide the technology to shift energy usage to the times when cheaper renewables are available in the grid and export to the grid at times when the price is highest. It’s a cheaper way to buy power, **a more rewarding way to sell power,** and the fastest way for Australia to reach 100% renewable energy.  

We are growing rapidly and have thousands of customers who love what we are doing and a great product that will play a significant role in driving Australia towards a renewable future. We are backed by **Australia’s leading VCs (including Square Peg Capital and Main Sequence Ventures)**, impact\-focused investors and individuals, and **most recently by Commonwealth Bank, NRMA and Gentrack**.  

We’re now at a critical moment in taking the business to real scale as we disrupt a huge market for the better. You’d be a part of a **rapidly growing team of over 140**, with expertise across energy, technology, marketing, and operations. We’re committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace and a great culture of people who love coming to work to build a better world. **About the role**  

Want to help improve the environment by shifting Australia’s energy usage towards renewables?  

We are currently hiring for **mid\-level Software Engineers.** Amber provides a great opportunity to apply your skills as an Engineer to help enable the uptake of renewable energy. Our technology optimises thousands of batteries and other devices in the customers' homes, enabling them to time their usage to consume power at times of high renewable penetration (and cheap prices), and then export power back to the grid at critical times \- letting them outbid coal and gas generators and earn potentially \>$100 in an afternoon. **The Amber Electric product team develops and supports:*** **Home automation integrations** (to batteries, hot water systems and pool pumps, with EVs coming soon) that control electricity usage in response to pricing and renewable availability
* **Mobile \& Web apps** for customers to monitor and manage their energy usage
* A **pricing and billing engine** for real time energy pricing
* The **marketing site and associated tools** to drive customer growth

  

The **tech stack** is **React Native mobile app**, some **React web frontends**, and a **Serverless Lambda backend on AWS**. We’re using **Typescript top to bottom**, and **Apollo GraphQL** sits in the middle. We keep our data in **DynamoDB** and **Timescale**, using one or the other as best suits a particular workload. **You can learn more about our tech stack at** **https://stackshare.io/companies/amber\-electric**  

While we’re looking for talented and driven individuals our desire is to build a champion team, not a team of champions. We’re full\-stack\-ish; while it’s impossible for everyone to excel across every layer of the stack we value people who can chip in wherever they’re needed. We’re committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace from the ground up. We want engineers who are as comfortable communicating with people as they are with their code.
### **Qualifications and Skills**

* We **favour generalists** who can be or looking to be flexible across the stack, both frontend and backend
* Growing verbal and written communication skills built on a foundation of empathy for your fellow humans is essential

### **Your responsibilities**

* Write and maintain high quality program code across the stack in the areas of your speciality

* Research, consult, analyse and evaluate our system requirements
* Test, debug, diagnose and correct errors in our tech stack according to our operational specifications
* Support the app across the whole lifecycle from idea through to production

### **Benefits**

* We’re committed to **building a diverse and inclusive workplace** and a great culture of people who love coming to work to build a better world

* Be part of a **growing technology start\-up** that will shape the future of household renewable energy use
* **Flexible working hours** with provision for regular work from home arrangements and a central hub in Melbourne CBD

***We are also open to working 4 days a week if that's what you are looking for. We mostly work from home, catching up in a co\-working space in the CBD every now and then. We expect to remain Melbourne based but maintain flexibility between the office and WFH.***

**About Mutinex**  

We're an early\-stage B2B SaaS startup with a proven platform, big\-name clients, and millions in revenue. We're not chasing unicorn status; we're building a sustainable, long\-lasting business (think Bowhead Whale!). Mutinex helps marketers understand their ROI and make smarter decisions with their budget.  

We're a hybrid team based in Sydney, Melbourne, and New York. We value communication, open\-mindedness, and a culture of feedback. All staff receive equity (ESOP), and we offer increasing annual leave based on tenure.### **The role**

  

As a Staff\+ Software Engineer on our Internal Tooling team, you'll be instrumental in driving efficiency and effectiveness across Mutinex. You’ll be at the forefront of leveraging AI, particularly agentic AI, to automate internal business processes, build and own shared infrastructure, and create tooling that empowers our Product and Engineering teams. This is a high\-impact role where you’ll shape the future of our internal operations and development environment, and have a significant influence on our overall productivity and culture.  

**Role Responsibilities:*** **AI\-Powered Tooling Development:** Design, develop, and deploy AI\-driven tools and automation to streamline internal workflows, both within engineering and across the broader organization. This includes exploring and implementing agentic AI solutions to automate complex tasks and improve overall efficiency.
* **Shared Infrastructure Ownership:** Own and maintain critical shared infrastructure components, ensuring their reliability, scalability, and security. This involves designing and implementing infrastructure\-as\-code, monitoring, and alerting solutions.
* **Internal Process Automation:** Identify opportunities to automate manual processes across the organization, including but not limited to engineering. Implement solutions that reduce toil, improve efficiency, and accelerate operational effectiveness.
* **Collaboration and Enablement:** Work closely with Product, Engineering, and other teams (e.g., Marketing, Sales) to understand their needs and develop tooling solutions that address their pain points. Provide guidance and support to ensure effective adoption of new tools and technologies.
* **Technical Leadership:** Provide technical leadership and mentorship to other engineers on the team. Promote best practices in software development, AI implementation, and infrastructure management.

### **About Mutinex**


We might be an early stage startup but we already have strong product market fit, household name clients (Samsung, Mars, CUB and ING to name a few) and millions in revenue.  

  

Being early stage means we're also still pretty scrappy and you wouldn't be coming into a well oiled machine, yet. But you would get a lot of opportunity to design, build and oil the machine until it's super oily.  

  

We aren't aiming to be another Tech Unicorn because Unicorns aren't real. We are aiming (and confident of being) more like a real and really big animal that lives for a long time, like a Bowhead Whale.  

  

Mutinex is a startup B2B SaaS platform that provides in\-depth data analytics for marketers to better understand their ROI and make better decisions with future spend.  

Founded in Australia, we've hit millions in ARR \& have seed funding ($5 million in May 2023 \& $9\.5 million in October 2023 backed by EVP) that we'll use for growing our team to continue to improve our product, bring in new customers and enable them to make better and more informed decisions.
  

We have a hybrid work environment with teams in Sydney, Melbourne and expanding into the US.  

  

With a team of around 60 people we value high quality communication, strong opinions that are held loosely and people who can give and take feedback well.  

  

Equity (ESOP) is offered to all staff on top of their salary and we also offer additional annual leave after 1 year of tenure (from 20 to 25 days a year) that continues to grow another day each year of service until you max out at 30 days per year.",,https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Overview/W-EI_IE8875923.htm,,,,,,,Software Engineer
