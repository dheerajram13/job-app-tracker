**About Mutinex**  

We're an early\\-stage B2B SaaS startup with a proven platform, big\\-name clients, and millions in revenue. We're not chasing unicorn status; we're building a sustainable, long\\-lasting business (think Bowhead Whale!). Mutinex helps marketers understand their ROI and make smarter decisions with their budget.  

We're a hybrid team based in Sydney, Melbourne, and New York. We value communication, open\\-mindedness, and a culture of feedback. All staff receive equity (ESOP), and we offer increasing annual leave based on tenure.### **The role**

  

As a Staff\\+ Software Engineer on our Internal Tooling team, you'll be instrumental in driving efficiency and effectiveness across Mutinex. You’ll be at the forefront of leveraging AI, particularly agentic AI, to automate internal business processes, build and own shared infrastructure, and create tooling that empowers our Product and Engineering teams. This is a high\\-impact role where you’ll shape the future of our internal operations and development environment, and have a significant influence on our overall productivity and culture.  

**Role Responsibilities:*** **AI\\-Powered Tooling Development:** Design, develop, and deploy AI\\-driven tools and automation to streamline internal workflows, both within engineering and across the broader organization. This includes exploring and implementing agentic AI solutions to automate complex tasks and improve overall efficiency.
* **Shared Infrastructure Ownership:** Own and maintain critical shared infrastructure components, ensuring their reliability, scalability, and security. This involves designing and implementing infrastructure\\-as\\-code, monitoring, and alerting solutions.
* **Internal Process Automation:** Identify opportunities to automate manual processes across the organization, including but not limited to engineering. Implement solutions that reduce toil, improve efficiency, and accelerate operational effectiveness.
* **Collaboration and Enablement:** Work closely with Product, Engineering, and other teams (e.g., Marketing, Sales) to understand their needs and develop tooling solutions that address their pain points. Provide guidance and support to ensure effective adoption of new tools and technologies.
* **Technical Leadership:** Provide technical leadership and mentorship to other engineers on the team. Promote best practices in software development, AI implementation, and infrastructure management.
* **Research and Innovation:** Stay up\\-to\\-date with the latest advancements in AI, software development, and DevOps. Proactively explore new technologies and approaches to improve our internal tooling and business processes.

* **AI Enthusiasm:** You are passionate about AI and its potential to transform internal operations. You have a strong interest in exploring and implementing agentic AI solutions.
* **Cloud Proficiency:** You have extensive experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) and a deep understanding of cloud\\-native technologies.
* **Automation Mindset:** You have a strong desire to automate everything. You are skilled in implementing automation solutions using a variety of tools and technologies.
* **DevOps Expertise:** You have a solid understanding of DevOps principles and practices. You are experienced with infrastructure\\-as\\-code, CI/CD, and monitoring tools.
* **Technical Leadership:** You have a proven track record of providing technical leadership and mentorship to other engineers.
* **Excellent Communicator:** You can effectively communicate technical concepts to both technical and non\\-technical audiences.
* **Proactive Problem Solver:** You can identify and solve complex challenges, taking a proactive and analytical approach.

  

### **About Mutinex**


We might be an early stage startup but we already have strong product market fit, household name clients (Samsung, Mars, CUB and ING to name a few) and millions in revenue.  

  

Being early stage means we're also still pretty scrappy and you wouldn't be coming into a well oiled machine, yet. But you would get a lot of opportunity to design, build and oil the machine until it's super oily.  

  

We aren't aiming to be another Tech Unicorn because Unicorns aren't real. We are aiming (and confident of being) more like a real and really big animal that lives for a long time, like a Bowhead Whale.  

  

Mutinex is a startup B2B SaaS platform that provides in\\-depth data analytics for marketers to better understand their ROI and make better decisions with future spend.  

Founded in Australia, we've hit millions in ARR \\& have seed funding ($5 million in May 2023 \\& $9\\.5 million in October 2023 backed by EVP) that we'll use for growing our team to continue to improve our product, bring in new customers and enable them to make better and more informed decisions.
  

We have a hybrid work environment with teams in Sydney, Melbourne and expanding into the US.  

  

With a team of around 60 people we value high quality communication, strong opinions that are held loosely and people who can give and take feedback well.  

  

Equity (ESOP) is offered to all staff on top of their salary and we also offer additional annual leave after 1 year of tenure (from 20 to 25 days a year) that continues to grow another day each year of service until you max out at 30 days per year.","","https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Overview/W-EI_IE8875923.htm","","","","","",""
