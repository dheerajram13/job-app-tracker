We are looking for a scientific software engineer to work in Forecast Application Software team, part of the Research to Operations Program (R2O), to develop the Bureau's Graphical Forecast Editor (GFE) and associated software applications.  

Our ideal candidate can logically and creatively solve problems and is passionate about doing a job well. They possess strong analytical skills and a desire to develop their skills further on the job. As a team player they are comfortable working with a diverse team and can communicate their work effectively to non\-experts.  

As a scientific software engineer in the R2O Program, you will join a team of meteorologists and software engineers and will employ best practices in software development, such as version control, automated testing, code reviews and configuration management. The focus of this work is on collaborative development, testing, and documentation of forecast process tools and natural language generation code written in Python and run on a Red Hat Linux platform. While we currently use python 2\.7, we expect to complete upgrading to python 3 within 12 months.  

The tools developed by the team are used by the Bureau’s operational Meteorologists to produce an Australia\-wide gridded database of seven\-day weather forecast information and corresponding text forecasts. This is a great opportunity to work on meaningful software applications for the public good, in a scientific environment with a commitment to innovation and quality.

The Research to Operations Program (R2O) is one of two programs within the Science and Innovation Group. It brings science into practice by accelerating the transfer of research into real\-world application. A key focus for R2O is to deliver impact and value for the Bureau's customers by transferring into operations our numerical models and analytic and processing systems that require high\-performance computing and data.  

  

The Observations and Assimilation team is seeking a talented senior scientific software engineer to support its work managing a range of operational data, including satellite observations, and undertaking development for their application in forecasts and other Bureau information products. Our ideal candidate will make contributions to operationalisation and support of new and upgraded software systems for data assimilation and for preparing near\-real\-time global observations from satellite and other sources, for a range of uses including assimilation into operational climate, water and weather forecasting models, developed as part of the Bureau's Research and Development plan 2020\-2030\.  

  

To be successful in the role you will have software engineering and computer science knowledge. You will have the capability to lead the delivery and support of software systems and be a team player.
